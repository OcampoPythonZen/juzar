#### Overview
The project uses environment variables for configuration. A `.env.example` file is provided as a template. Copy this to `.env` and update the values as needed.

#### Getting Started
1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Update the values in `.env` for your environment
3. Never commit `.env` to version control

#### Configuration Sections

##### Application
```ini
NODE_ENV=development

#### Environment-Specific Files
- `.env` - Local development (not versioned)
- `.env.development` - Development defaults
- `.env.production` - Production defaults
- `.env.example` - Example configuration (versioned)

#### Best Practices
1. **Security**
   - Never commit sensitive data to version control
   - Use environment variables for all environment-specific configurations
   - Keep production credentials secure and never commit them

2. **Development**
   - Use `.env.development` for local development overrides
   - Document all environment variables in `.env.example`
   - Keep environment variables organized by section

3. **Production**
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production` in production
   - Configure proper caching headers
   - Enable all performance optimizations

#### Troubleshooting
- If environment variables aren't loading:
  1. Ensure the variable is prefixed with `VITE_`
  2. Restart the development server after changing `.env`
  3. Check for typos in variable names
  4. Verify the `.env` file is in the project root
